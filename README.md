## Hello UNCC Data Annalytics Bootcamp graders! This is my module 3 challenge!
For this challenge I mainly tried to use my own method of problem solving, and used search engines to help me figure out any erros I would stumble uppon. 
I also tried to make use of list and dictionaries so I could use python functions like min, max, len and sum, this was to try to keep down long for if loops.
Hopefully this is a good submission and my code works well, thanks for checking it out!
